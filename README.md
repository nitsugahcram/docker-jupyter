# docker-jupyterlab

The intent is to generate a docker image with Jupyter lab, without conda.

This project is base on https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/,

# Jupyter Docker Stacks

Jupyter Docker Stacks are a set of ready-to-run [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/jupyter)
containing Jupyter applications and interactive computing tools.

## Images

- base-lab:
- pyspark-lab:


## Quick Start

You can try a
[recent build of the jupyter/base-notebook image on mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyter/docker-stacks/master?filepath=README.ipynb)
by simply clicking the preceding link. Otherwise, the two examples below may help you get started if
you [have Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/) know
[which Docker image](http://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html) you
want to use, and want to launch a single Jupyter Notebook server in a container.
